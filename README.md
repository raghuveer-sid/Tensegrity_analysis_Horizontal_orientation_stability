# Tensegrity analysis - Horizontal orientation stability

  - A bio-inspired piping inspection robot was designed and developed at LS2N,France. This robot accomplishes the locomotion of a caterpillar in six steps to move inside a pipeline. However, the prototype is a rigid model which restricts its application to straight pipelines. By the addition of articulation units, the robot can be made reconfigurable. Some interesting researches on piping inspection robots that pass through pipe bends include i) The robot of Chen et al. Where double hook joint is employed, ii) THES-I robot of Hirose and al. Where a universal joint actuated by DC-motor is used and iii) Robot of Brunete and al, that uses SMA spring with microcontrollers. Most of these researches have articulation units either in passive mode or active mode but not a combination of both. By analyzing key design issues namely passive compliance, active compliance and tilt limits, a tensegrity mechanism that uses a passive universal joint and three tension springs was proposed as a solution for the bio-inspired robot of LS2N.This mechanism can work passively when the robot passes through a pipe bend at œÄ/2 radians. In the event of a T- union or junction, cable actuation can be performed on the tensegrity mechanism to follow a given path.

  - A Tensegrity analysis in Horizontal orientation is performed on the structure in order to determine its stability with zero applied forces and with a preload. A tensegrity structure is said to be stable when the resultant moments are zero and also when the second order derivative of the total potential energy i.e, ùêæùñ∫ is positive.

# Conclusion

  - The purpose of this project is to find the stability of the tensegrity in horizontal orientation. From the above results it can be said that with the static force analysis, this system was found to be unstable under zero applied forces. By fixing several parameters, the parameter h was modified to obtain a stable configuration under the presence of preload
